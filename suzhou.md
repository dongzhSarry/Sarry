# Suzhou Urban Redesign

## The Problem

#### Over-dense buildings

#### History of Canal
Since the Tang Dynasty, China’s Grand Canal has been a major transportation route linking the coastal cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo and Suzhou, with the major inland cities of Luoyang, Kaifeng and Beijing. Suzhou is an important city close to the sea end of the Grand Canal which is a world cultural heritage site. <br>

The image on the left below shows that the site is located in the south-west corner of ancient Suzhou. On its western side is the main river [city moat] that has been there for at least one thousand years. At the top left of the middle image is where this river links to the Grand Canal. This river was once an important transportation route for the entire city.

This next image is a model of one side of the canal on the south-west corner of Suzhou. This part of the canal has two major problems shared by canals in other parts of the city. <br>

#### Waste of cultural heritage
As shown in the following composite image, the site has important gardens (shown in green) and culturally important buildings (shown in red) but, as can be seen in the photographs that follow, the environment between them is often unattractive and doers not provide a good setting for the important cultural artifacts.

#### Neglected channels
Some channels are neglected and unused and the walls are not being maintained. Some channels have been hidden by new development, and this leads to further neglect. Some channels have been filled-in to create more roads. Not only this, rainwater from shops and restaurants built next to the channels flows directly into the channels and pollutes them.

However, in Suzhou and elsewhere, the development of cities and the growing importance of road transportation led to the gradual abandonment of canals, and the number of waterways gradually decreased in the Qing Dynasty and later. In modern times, due to industrialization, urban development and increased building density, the water system has gradually been made obsolete and in some places filled in.

The next pictures shows parts of the ancient river course. There are many parts of the ancient city where there are still traditional revetments, but the original ancient revetments are rare.


## Techniques
#### Connections in cities
##### Subway line

#### Programs
##### Venice
In the process of protection and renewal, Venice has encountered the problems of over-exploitation of tourism and continuous loss of indigenous people. In order to attract residents and better protect historical and cultural resources, the city has introduced cultural and art education functions. Moreover, Venice has also inserted a variety of urban functional areas in the cultural and educational area, such as business district, residential area, office area and so on. This not only promotes the preservation of Venetian culture, but also promotes people’s communication and facilitates people’s life.

#### Channels
##### Giudecca, Venice
Giudecca, Venice has well preserved waterways. The river still runs in all directions, and boats and canals are still the main means of transportation. The buildings on both sides of the river remain in the local style and the people live different lives from the people on Venice’s main island. Giudecca Island is therefore a good reference for the reconstruction of Suzhou canals.

#### Markets
##### Port of Baltimore, United States
Baltimore’s Market is one of the top destinations for travelers on the East Coast of the United States, thanks to its many attractions. The location of the harbor market is very favorable. The outdoor activity space of the mall is close to the water, and customers here can enjoy the beautiful view of the harbor. The harbor market is one of the largest established markets in the United States. The daily flow of people and goods is very large. It has convenient transportation organization and planning, and people can easily reach the harbor market by light rail, railway or highway. The Baltimore Redevelopment Project itself is a success in terms of economy and image. The project has greatly improved the spatial quality of the Baltimore and contributed to the prosperity of the city and the improvement of the community environment. Here I think of not only the need to protect the local culture and traditional scenery, but also the need to expand the market and the role of radiation drive to attract non-local residents. It is necessary to improve other modes of transportation and improve the economy and image of the city while protecting the river, which is also a necessary factor for urban development.

#### Combining traditional and modern architecture
##### Tokyo Yanaka area
In Tokyo Tanaka area, through the active use of old buildings to realize the renewal of block functions, the organic integration of daily life culture with historical buildings, streets, natural environment and other elements, emphasizing the cultivation of historical life culture. This combination of old and new buildings preserves the traditional architectural style, allowing people to enjoy both the technology of contemporary architecture and the culture of traditional architecture, which is of great value for the architectural transformation in the urban construction of Suzhou.
